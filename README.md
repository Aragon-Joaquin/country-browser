# Vanilla JS - Country Browser

another webpage for my university. (for some reason i cant build the page normally since it deletes most of the code and i been doing this for 8hs straight (dw i figure it out))

- original design (its horrible)
- documented (70% of the code)
- and no dependencies (except of vite)

using this api:

- https://restcountries.com

**and i forgot to tell ya. the webpage looks more horrible using the firefox engine**
