![lading image](/.github/landing.png)

another webpage for my university. (for some reason i cant build the page normally since it deletes most of the code and i been doing this for 8hs straight (dw i figure it out))

- original design (its horrible)
- documented (most of it)
- and no dependencies (except of vite)

#### features:

- light mode / dark mode
- sanitizes output w/ adapter
- error handling

---

using this api:

- https://restcountries.com

**and i forgot to tell ya. the webpage looks more horrible using the firefox engine**
